Additionally, discuss the balance between the emphasis on proper language mechanics and the potential limitations on creativity in language expression. Ensure that your response reflects a deep understanding of the structural view of language and its implications for English language teaching.\nIn a critical analysis, compare and contrast the Direct Method and the Grammar-Translation Method. Identify and discuss the key principles that differentiate these two language teaching methods. Additionally, evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching techniques associated with each method. Support your analysis with examples and consider the implications of these methods on language acquisition and proficiency.\nIn light of the historical context and critiques discussed in the Audio Lingual Method, evaluate critically the reasons behind the decline in popularity of the Audio-lingual Method.
